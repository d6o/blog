      <description>Building and Evolving My Personal Server: From Naive Trading Bots to a Streamlined Docker Setup with Caddy
Back in 2017, I embarked on an exciting (and somewhat naive) adventure when I created my first personal server (a $2.50/month instance on Vultr). It was a modest setup—just half a shared CPU, 512 MB of RAM, and 10 GB of SSD storage—but at the time, it felt like more than enough for my needs.</description>

      <description>Reviving My Mom&amp;rsquo;s Love for Retro Gaming with Lakka and a Raspberry Pi 5
A few months ago, I visited my parents, which coincided with Apple&amp;rsquo;s recent shift in allowing emulation apps on their devices. RetroArch had become available on the Apple TV, and that was the catalyst for this entire journey. Growing up, I had an Atari (though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which model), a Sega Master System Mark III, and later a PlayStation 1.</description>

      <description>After switching from Firefox to LibreWolf, I became interested in the idea of self-hosting my own Firefox Sync server. Although I had seen this was possible before, I had never really looked into it—until now. I embarked on a journey to set this up, and while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely smooth sailing, I eventually got it working. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went.
Finding the Right Sync Server Initial Search: Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Sync Server Repo I started by searching for &amp;ldquo;firefox sync server github&amp;rdquo; and quickly found Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s syncserver repo.</description>

      <description>The internet has been a central part of my life for as long as I can remember. It all started in the early 2000s when my parents bought our first family computer. Back then, internet access was limited, and I could only use it on Saturdays after 2 pm because bandwidth was cheaper during off-peak hours. But those restrictions didn’t bother me; I was hooked on exploring the digital world. I spent countless hours trying to discover new game websites, looking for tips to beat my PlayStation games, or finding fun browser-based games.</description>

      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through how to use Go to subscribe to new blocks on the Ethereum blockchain and print out the transaction hashes for each block. This is a common task when working with Ethereum, especially for monitoring or analytics purposes.
Prerequisites Before we start, make sure you have the following:
Go installed on your machine.
Access to an Ethereum node. You can use a service like Infura or run your own Ethereum node.</description>
